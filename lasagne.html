    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The lasagna of Naples, lasagne di carnevale, is layered with local sausage, small fried meatballs, hard-boiled eggs, ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, and sauced with a Neapolitan ragù, a meat sauce.[10]
            Lasagne al forno, layered with a thicker ragù and béchamel sauce and corresponding to the most common version of the dish outside Italy, is traditionally associated with the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. 
            Here, and especially in its capital, Bologna, layers of lasagna are traditionally green (the color is obtained by mixing spinach or other vegetables into the dough)[11] and served with 
            ragù (a thick sauce made from onions, carrots, celery, finely ground pork and beef, butter, and tomatoes),[12][13] bechamel and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
            
            In other regions lasagna can be made with various combinations of ricotta or mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, meats (such as ground beef, pork or chicken), and vegetables (such as spinach, zucchini, olives, mushrooms), 
            and the dish is typically flavoured with wine, garlic, onion, and oregano. In all cases, the lasagne are baked (al forno).
            Traditionally pasta dough prepared in Southern Italy used semolina and water; in the northern regions, where semolina was not available, flour and eggs were used. In modern Italy, 
            since the only type of wheat allowed for commercially sold pasta is durum wheat, industrial lasagna are made of semolina from durum wheat.[14] Nonetheless, in the north and especially in Emilia-Romagna, 
            the tradition of egg-based dough remains popular for artisanal and home-made productions.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li> 
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 carrot, diced</li>
        <li>1 celery stalk, diced</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, finely sliced</li>
        <li>250g beef mince</li>
        <li>250g pork mince</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato purée</li>
        <li>400g tin chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>200ml beef stock</li>
        <li>200ml red wine</li>
        <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>9-12 lasagne sheets (depending on the size of your baking dish)</li>
        <li>50g Parmesan, grated</li>
        <li>150g pack mozzarella, shredded</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the white sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>50g butter</li>
        <li>50g plain flour</li>
        <li>550ml semi-skimmed milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pan, heat the olive oil over a low heat. Fry the onion, carrot, celery and garlic for 5 mins, or until softened. 
                Add the mince and fry on a medium heat until golden. 
                Turn up the heat, pour in the wine and bubble until reduced. 
                Stir in the tomato purée, chopped tomatoes and stock. 
                Add in the Worcestershire sauce and simmer for 15 mins, or until the liquid has reduced. 
                Season.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the white sauce. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over a low heat and add the flour. 
                Whisk until combined and cook on low for 1-2 mins. Remove from the heat and gradually whisk in the milk until you have a loose sauce. 
                Season. Return to a gentle heat and whisk constantly until the sauce thickens.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Layer up the lasagne in a baking dish, starting with a third each of the ragu, then the pasta, then the white sauce. 
                Repeat twice. Top with the Parmesan and mozzarella then bake in the oven for 40-45 mins, until piping hot and crisp and bubbling on top. 
                Serve immediately.</li>
